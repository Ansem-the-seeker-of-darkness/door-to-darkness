        <h1>Prologue: The Coming Wave</h1>
        <p>
            The prologue sets the stage by introducing the concept of a "coming wave" of technology that will bring a turning point in human history. 
            It raises the central question of whether this wave can be contained and explores the potential dramatic and dire consequences if it cannot, 
            alongside the lost opportunities if its fruits are not harnessed. The title is self-explanatory, referring to the imminent and impactful arrival of these transformative technologies.

                <h3>Chapter 1: Containment Is Not Possible</h3>
                <p>
                    This chapter argues that, at first glance, containing the coming wave of technology appears impossible. 
                    It poses the fundamental question of the book: why might this be true, and what are the implications? 
                    The title is directly justified by this initial assertion and the chapter's exploration of the difficulty in controlling technological proliferation.

                <p>
                    This chapter examines the history of technology as a series of waves of innovation that have spread ceaselessly throughout time. 
                    It discusses how general-purpose technologies transform society and how history shows a consistent pattern of technological proliferation with both intended and unintended consequences. 
                    The title reflects this historical pattern of unending technological diffusion.

                <p>
                    This chapter focuses on the core challenge of "keeping a grip" on the most valuable technologies as they become cheaper and spread faster than any in history. 
                    It introduces the idea of containment as a set of technical, social, and legal mechanisms to manage technology. 
                    The title highlights the inherent difficulty in containing the spread of powerful technologies.

                <p>
                    This chapter identifies and describes four unique characteristics of the coming technological wave that make the challenge of containment significantly harder: 
                    asymmetry, hyper-evolution, omni-use, and autonomy. The title highlights these four distinctive attributes that make this wave particularly difficult to control.

                <p>
                    This chapter analyzes the powerful driving forces behind the creation and spread of these technologies, including geopolitical competition, massive financial rewards, 
                    an open research culture, and individual ego. It argues that as long as these incentives exist, the wave will inevitably progress. 
                    The title emphasizes the "unstoppable" nature of these underlying motivations propelling the wave forward.

                <p>
                    This chapter examines the fundamental "grand bargain" of the nation-state: in exchange for a monopoly on the use of force, citizens expect the state to maintain order 
                    and provide public services, including managing new technologies. The title refers to this implicit agreement between the state and its citizens, which will be strained by the coming wave.

                <p>
                    This chapter explores how the technologies of the coming wave will amplify existing vulnerabilities of the nation-state, such as new forms of violence, misinformation, 
                    job displacement, and catastrophic accidents. The title highlights how the wave will act as an "amplifier" of existing weaknesses and instabilities within states.

                <p>
                    This chapter contemplates the profound consequences of an uncontained wave for the future of nations, suggesting potential scenarios of eroding liberal democratic states 
                    or the rise of supercharged authoritarian states. The title focuses on the transformation of the geopolitical landscape and the fate of nation-states in the era of the coming wave.
